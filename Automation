1) Flow - Duplicate Rule for Schedule
This Flow is to prevent duplicate schedule involving same movie starting at the same time at the same theater location. 
We could not use duplicate rules because matching rule only allows one lookup field. Schedule record involves atleast two lookups to be checked i.e. theater and movie. 

Flow - Create Booking
This Flow is to create a booking and will be used in an Agentforce agent.
